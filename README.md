Naïve Bayes Classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes’ theorem with strong(naïve) independence in assumptions between the features.
Bayes theorem plays a critical role in probabilistic learning and classification.
Uses prior probability of each category given no information about an item.
Categorization produces a posterior probability distribution over the possible categories given a description of an item.
It is fast and as compared to other algorithms, it is easy to compute.
